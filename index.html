          I'm' an advid gamer in my spare time. When I say gaming I mean all gaming, just having a good time. Though in the past few
          years my video gaming has slowed down drastically, and I primarly play role-playing and board games, when I find
          the time. I really enjoy the company of others around a table smiling having a good time over a mic and headphones
          these days.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a collector of mostly McFarelane statues, but any artwork works for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a chainmailler. Yes chainmailler you read that right, I Design, Create and Make Chainmaille Jewlery and Accessories,
          and soon I plan to make full on armor. You can find my work if your interested at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/vitalityhandmade"
            target=_blank>Vitality Handmade Designs Facebook Page</a>. My biggest seller to date is our Chainmail Dicebags.

          Overall I can be summed up to an always positive, and eager to learn new things kinda person who enjoys all forms of culture.
          I love stargazing, looking out on the horizon and seeing an amazing sunset, and I enjoy a good night on the couch,
          although I enjoy sitting around a table in good company the most. Couple drinks, laughter from the table and kids
          in the background. Nothing can beat it.
        </p>

        <h3>How I got here:</h3>
        <p>
          The 90's. Big hair, rock&roll and the interwebs... Windows95. HTML2. FreeBSD. Apache. Tools I was into it all, I was the
          BMX Freestyle, Skateboard, RollerBlader who listened to punk rock, and was in love with computers. My first computer
          was a Tandy, and it didnt stop there, I would take handme downs from wherever I could using 3.1 and eventually
          FreeBSD. Once Win95 hit and we started learning about HTML2. It was an obsession for my friend and I, multiple
          pc's lined up on handmade desks running our own apache servers, learning everything we could.
        </p>
        <p>
          My thought process as I got older was I want to always love doing this so I don't want to to it for a living. That is when
          I started schooling to become an automotive tech, like many in my family. This left the door open to keep computers
          a hobby and fun. Over the course of 17 years of being many things, I have always kept computers my top hobby. Either
          gaming, simple web development, or just building them for friends / family or myself. Web Development has always
          been something I have enjoyed and held onto. I just only recently decided to make it a career focus, something
          I wish I did many years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an automotive tech I learned a lot of things that cross over to Web Development. Like you will never know everything that
          is why they make books and now databases of knowledge about everything. One of the best quotes one of my teachers
          told me in my first automotive school was
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Your job is to not remember every make, model, type, your not hired to remember everything, your hired to diagnoise and
          repair. Your job is to know how and where to look up what is needed for the job your working on."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          That has resinated with me over the years in everything I do. I know I will never know everything, there will always be someone
          smarter, better and faster then me, but that is what drives me. To learn more, to become better, faster and smarter
          then myself the day before.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2008 I injuried my back and am unable to do that type of work anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2009 my wife and I started a company called "Vitality Handmade Designs", small company out of the house doing small events.
          I fell in love with a new hobby Chainmaille. I started designing, creating, and making chainmaille jewlery and
          accessories. In 2014 we launched a very successful Kickstarter for chainmaille dicebags. I managed over 200 clients,
          shipping, and creating over 375 bags over the course of 8 months.
        </p>

        <p>
          2010. Birth of our daughter. I have been a stay at home father since 2010 to my daughter and now my son as well and enjoyed
          every minute of it so far, but now it's time for a fresh start.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fiance and I decided in 2015 we were going to move to Arizona and get a fresh start after our son was born in Novemeber.
          Well plans always need to be altered, our son was born with a heart condition and needed surgery on the east coast
          (long long story short he is doing just great!). 2016 was a rollercoaster of a time since both my fiance and I
          decided to start learning new careers (prior to knowing about the surgery). She signed up for college on-line and
          I was deep into learning Web Development. I still remember sitting bedside at the hospital on the old old laptop
          trying to wrap my brain around Bootstrap! I started learning Javascript during recovery!
        </p>
        <p>
          It was rough to say the least, my fiance worked full-time came home and did her school thing at night, I was taking care
          of our children from 6am - 8pm then I would sit down and work on learning until 12-1am. Rince and Repeat.. I'm
          not sharing this story to inact sympothy, or how much of a struggle I went through. I'm sharing in hopes of showing
          you my dedication. If your looking at portfolio looking for a developer who is dedicated, and has a desire to grow
          and learn, I am that person. I am humble in my knowledge, that I don't know everything, and I love to share my
          knowledge when I can. During 2016 I started a online study group on google, hosting weekly hangouts at night. My
          goal was to reaffirm my knowledge and share that with those who needed help. For those that were in the group seemed
          to benifit, just as much as I did.

          2015: I started with CodeCademy.com. I wanted to see where I stood with my knowledge of HTML vs. current HTML standards.
          I learned quickly that I had a very solid core to work with. I was able to create basic HTMl / css sites quick.
          Learning some of the new elements, and css styling options was easy enough. CodeCademy was great in that it taught
          me the basics of Bootstrap and the concept of grids without even knowing it. So when it came time to learn that
          directly, I already had a solid foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2016: Javascript... When first being introduced to Javascript, it felt like I was trying to tame a wild animal. I first started
          with CodeCademy, then moved to Udemy, then back to CodeCademy... It was a struggle at first, but then I had my
          AH-HAH moment! I figured out how to work a for loop. Yes that is what did it for me, once I figured that out it's
          like I understood everything else. Or at least I thought I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned the basics of Javascript then moved to jQuery as all the "experts" said from reading articles and youtube vids,
          and hearing about "Javascript: The Good Parts". I figured Javascript was flawed, and started to follow in the trends.
          Thankfully I came across Kyle Simpson, and felt the same as he preaches. Javascript is powerful, and great if used
          properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You Don't Know JS" series of books are great, and I plan to re-read them multiple times when time permits. For now though
          I have taken that advice and I took a LOT of time learning Javascript. I did multiple courses on Udemy, Lynda,
          CodeCademy (again), and then i discovered <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a>, and
          I have never looked back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can say with certainty that I know HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with various libraries / frameworks on a strong level.
          Although I do fully understand these are just tools, and what will make me a developer / engineer, is not the languages
          I know, but how I use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          With <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> you are faced with simple to advanced challenges, and
          projects all developed in open source by industry developers. They do not handhold, they give a simple hint of
          where you should start. Going from a CodeCademy or Udemy to this was a little shocking, I kept trying to reach
          for the out stretched hand like my kids do, but there was no one there. I learned quickly this is for the most
          part how it is in the real world, you're given a task and you figure it out with the tools at your disposal. I
          was addicted to this, I was doing 5+ hours straight of challenges, algorithms, projects each night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am one of 5% of all FreeCodeCamp active users who has achieved the Front-End Certificate, with doing the optional advanced
          algorithms. If you don't know about FreeCodeCamp, and you're reading this to evaluate me for a job, I highly advise
          taking a moment to take a look. It will really give you a sense of what I have achieved on my own, and what you
          would get with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since completing the Front-End Certificate I am continuing to follow the path from FreeCodeCamp. I have been learning and
          coding in ReactJS since November of 2016, and touched on Node.js as well before moving to Arizona.
        </p>
        <p>
          FreeCodeCamp does not currently have challenges and the like for ReactJS but they are working on it in there
          <a href="http://beta.freecodecamp.com">Beta Path</a>. So I have taken courses on CodeCademy, then moved on to Udemy
          courses, which I have earned my completion certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can say I have a solid understanding of ReactJS, and can develop React Apps. My Node.js knowledge is basic at best right
          now but I plan to change that soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to speaking to you if you're interested in me for a position, or just want to chat.

        <p>
          After I realized how much I was loving Javascript and Web Development overall, I decided I wanted to be in contact with other
          like minded people. With my son's surgery and wife in school, getting out and doing a in person "Coffee and Code"
          just wasn't practical, so I decided to start an online group on Google Hangouts.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea was to help others and gain some help myself, work with others on some challenges, or projects, and start a weekly
          video hangout where we can all get together and just go over things we know, and help each other. Most of the sessions
          I took the lead going over topics helping those understand things by screen sharing and live coding for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Topics included things like, css styling, animations, DOM manipulation with both jQuery and Vanilla JS. helping with portfolios,
          projects from FCC and with some game code.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I started packing to move from NJ to AZ back in Nov. of 2016, the group has died down a bit. Ranging from apx 30-40
          members, to just about 2 active members. I plan to revitalize this group once i'm settled into my new place.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal once it's up and running will be to run through FCC's new beta layout, contributing to the open source for it, group
          projects working as a team to add to our portfolios, and the popular weekly(maybe bi-weekly) discussion via. video
          chat sessions.

      <h4>History of CHOP</h4>
      <p>In 1855, Philadelphia had a population of about 460,000, and recorded 10,507 deaths. Leading causes of death were smallpox,
        typhoid, and scarlet fever. In the worst month of 1855, 300 children under 12 years old died, primarily of infectious
        diseases. A Philadelphia physician, Dr. Francis West Lewis, inspired by a visit to the new Great Ormond Street Hospital
        for Sick Children in London (founded 1852), enlisted Drs. T. Hewson Bache and R.A.F. Penrose to found the first children's
        hospital in North America.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1855</b> - On November 23, 1855 the following small advertisement appeared in the Philadelphia Public Ledger:
            <blockquote>
              <small>The Children's Hospital—located on Blight Street, running from Pine to Lombard, below Broad, is now open for the reception of Patients. Children suffering from Acute Diseases and Accidents will be received free of charge. A dispensary, for sick children, is also attached to the Hospital and will be open at the same place every day, (Sundays excepted from 11 to 12 o'clock, when advice and medicine will be given free of charge.)</small>
            </blockquote>
            The first location of the original Children's Hospital was a small building on Blight Street (now Watts St). The hospital
            consisted of 12 beds and a dispensary. That year they recorded 67 inpatient admissions and 306 outpatient visits.

            extending toward 18th and Bainbridge Sts. In 1919 the hospital became affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania
            School of Medicine. The affiliation became steadily closer over the next 17 years, with the Children's Hospital
            becoming identical to the pediatric department of the school of medicine, with most of the attending physicians
            appointed jointly to both institutions.</p>

            The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is in Philadelphia's University City neighborhood, and since 2001 has been undergoing
            a $1.5 billion expansion that has doubled the hospital's size, while also building more than one million square
            feet of new research and outpatient facilities on a large, eight acre site south of the main hospital on Civic
            Center Boulevard. The South Campus expansion includes the eleven-story Colket Translational Research Building,
            which will provide lab space for the Center for Childhood Cancer Research and the Center for Cellular and Molecular

            <b>2.16.2016</b> - Nathan Munker underwent open heart surgery by Dr. Thomas L Spray at The Children’s Hospital
            of Philadelphia. The surgery was a complete success and my son will now live a long happy life. </p>

      <p>This project was supposed to be just a first step into my new career field, to essentially show how to do a quick basic
        layout with HTML / CSS utilizing Bootstrap. I was asked to make a tribute page, I could not in good conscience choose
        some random movie star or band.<br>
        I wanted this to mean something to me, so I spent 2 days on something that took me just about 1 hour to make in total.
        I could not decide if I wanted to do it on Dr. Spray, or the staff of the hospital, or even just my Son and all he
        has gone through. In the end I decided on the hospital in a whole. Without the facility and the pioneering founding
        fathers who opened the doors in the first place, who knows what would have become of Nathan..<br>
        It’s unlikely this will ever reach the hospital, the staff or Dr. Spray, but thank you for giving my Son a chance.

      <p>It is my hope that this facility will need to be closed due to no more sick children ever, but that is not reality. Because of reality, and if you ever find yourself in need of special child care, know that CHOP is the leader from mine and my families experiences. You can find more information about them by visiting there offical web page, <a href="http://www.chop.edu">http://www.chop.edu</a>.
