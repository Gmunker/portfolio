        <h3>Personal:</h3>
        <p>My name is Greg Munker, born and rasied in Northen New Jersey, first and formost i'm a father of 2, younglings. They are my everything, and I do everything for
          the betterment of them. Outisde of that....
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm' an advid gamer in my spare time. When I say gaming I mean all gaming, just having a good
          time. Though in the past few years my video gaming has slowed down drastically, and I primarly play role-playing and board games, when I 
          find the time. I really enjoy the company of others around a table smiling having a good time over a mic and headphones these days. 
          </p>
        <p>
          I'm a collector of mostly McFarelane statues, but any artwork works for me. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a chainmailler. Yes chainmailler you read that right, I Design, Create and Make Chainmaille Jewlery and Accessories, and soon I plan to make full on armor. 
          You can find my work if your interested at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/vitalityhandmade" target=_blank >Vitality Handmade Designs Facebook Page</a>. My 
          biggest seller to date is our Chainmail Dicebags.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall I can be summed up to an always positive, and eager to learn new things kinda person who enjoys all forms of culture. I love stargazing, looking out 
          on the horizon and seeing an amazing sunset, and I enjoy a good night on the couch, although I enjoy sitting around a table in good company the most. Couple drinks,
          laughter from the table and kids in the background. Nothing can beat it. 
        </p>

        <h3>How I got here:</h3>
        <p>
          The 90's. Big hair, rock&roll and the interwebs... Windows95. HTML2. FreeBSD. Apache. Tools I was into it all, I was the BMX Freestyle, Skateboard, RollerBlader
          who listened to punk rock, and was in love with computers. My first computer was a Tandy, and it didnt stop there, I would take handme downs from wherever I could 
          using 3.1 and eventually FreeBSD. Once Win95 hit and we started learning about HTML2. It was an obsession for my friend and I, multiple pc's lined up on handmade desks
          running our own apache servers, learning everything we could.  
        </p>
        <p>
          My thought process as I got older was I want to always love doing this so I don't want to to it for a living. That is when I started schooling to become an automotive
          tech, like many in my family. This left the door open to keep computers a hobby and fun. Over the course of 17 years of being many things, I have always kept 
          computers my top hobby. Either gaming, simple web development, or just building them for friends / family or myself. Web Development has always been something
          I have enjoyed and held onto. I just only recently decided to make it a career focus, something I wish I did many years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an automotive tech I learned a lot of things that cross over to Web Development. Like you will never know everything
          that is why they make books and now databases of knowledge about everything. One of the best quotes one of my teachers told me in my first automotive school was
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Your job is to not remember every make, model, type, your not hired to remember everything, your hired to diagnoise and repair. Your job is to know how and where to 
          look up what is needed for the job your working on."
        </blockquote>
          
        <p>
          That has resinated with me over the years in everything I do. I know I will never know everything, there will always be someone smarter, better and faster then
          me, but that is what drives me. To learn more, to become better, faster and smarter then myself the day before. 
        </p>

          <p>
            In 2008 I injuried my back and am unable to do that type of work anymore.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In 2009 my wife and I started a company called "Vitality Handmade Designs", small company out of the house doing small events. I fell in love with a new hobby
            Chainmaille. I started designing, creating, and making chainmaille jewlery and accessories. In 2014 we launched a very successful Kickstarter for chainmaille
            dicebags. I managed over 200 clients, shipping, and creating over 375 bags over the course of 8 months. 
          </p>

          <p>
            2010. Birth of our daughter. I have been a stay at home father since 2010 to my daughter and now my son as well and enjoyed every minute of it so far, but 
            now it's time for a fresh start. 
          </p>
          <p>
          My fiance and I decided in 2015 we were going to move to Arizona and get a fresh start after our son was born in Novemeber. Well plans always need to be altered,
          our son was born with a heart condition and needed surgery on the east coast (long long story short he is doing just great!). 2016 was a rollercoaster of a time 
          since both my fiance and I decided to start learning new careers (prior to knowing about the surgery). She signed up for college on-line and I was deep into 
          learning Web Development. I still remember sitting bedside at the hospital on the old old laptop trying to wrap my brain around Bootstrap! I started learning
          Javascript during recovery!
          </p>
          <p>
          It was rough to say the least, my fiance worked full-time came home and did her school thing at night, I was taking care of our children from 6am - 8pm then I 
          would sit down and work on learning until 12-1am. Rince and Repeat.. I'm not sharing this story to inact sympothy, or how much of a struggle I went through. I'm
          sharing in hopes of showing you my dedication. If your looking at portfolio looking for a developer who is dedicated, and has a desire to grow and learn, I am that
          person. 
          
          I am humble in my knowledge, that I don't know everything, and I love to share my knowledge when I can. During 2016 I started a online study group on google,
          hosting weekly hangouts at night. My goal was to reaffirm my knowledge and share that with those who needed help. For those that were in the group seemed to benifit,
          just as much as I did. 
        </p>

        <h3>Education:</h3>
        <p>
          2015: I started with CodeCademy.com. I wanted to see where I stood with my knowledge of HTML vs. Curent HTML standards.
